    <h1>Bean and the Jackstalk</h1>
    <p>
      Bean was really clumsy. <br>
      His clumsiness constantly got in the way of his job as a trustworthy pharmacy technician. <br>
      Generally speaking, Bean was pretty good at counting medications when he wasn't dropping them, <br> but he was pretty good at dropping them.
      </p>

    <p>
      One day, Mr. Jack Stalk came into the pharmacy. <br>
      He needed a refill on his antibiotics. Or rather, he thought he did, because he had no idea that <br>
      his illness was viral and he was just creating antibiotic-resistant super bacteria <br>
      that would exterminate the human race. He had a cold, so it made sense to him. <br>
      Anyway, Mr. Stalk asked Bean to refill his species-destroying placebos. <br>
      <br> "I need some of those there azith throw my uh sins, Bean, you lowly pharmacy plebian." <br>
      <br> "Right away, Mr. Stalk. As long as I don't drop the box, I know you won't pox my blocks!" <br>
      Bean wasn't very good with his words. <br>
      </p>

    <p>
      Off Bean went. Searching high and low for the azithromycin, even though the medications <br>
      were in alphabetical order and he really shouldn't have been searching that long. <br>
      He finally found it on his third lap around. <br>
      He raised the box up high and he shouted: <br>
      "I've flocked the box full of chalks and rocks!" <br>
      The place was crowded. People were staring.
      </p>

    <p>
      Bean then, against his better judgment flung himself full speed toward the pharmacy counter <br>
      where Mr. Stalk was waiting. He immediately tripped over a phone he left off the hook and on the ground. <br>
      "One pharmacy call," it politely told him as he crumpled to the floor. <br>
      Needless to say, he dropped the block right in Mr. Stalk's clock.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      His eyes fell upon the face of the crumbled, crabbled, crombled Jack Stalk...<br>and
      that's when Bean fell to his knees in the kind of abject terror that
      only happens in short stories.<br><br>
      For he recognized that face. <br> It was just like his own. <br>
      Jack Stalk was none other than his twin brother! #JustSpookyEndings
