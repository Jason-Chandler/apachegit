    <h1>Jack and the Beanstalk</h1>
    <p>
      There once was a worthless low-life named Jack.<br>
      He really had nothing to do most of the time, <br>
      so he was always a big fatheaded jerk to whomever he came across.
      </p>

    <p>
      One day he came across a beanstalk.
      This beanstalk was an upstanding member of society. <br>
      He always helped out the homeless, <br>
      he didn't cut people off on the freeway, <br> he flossed everyday, <br>
      sometimes he even calmly wrote to his congressman when he had a complaint! <br>
      This beanstalk was grade A.
      </p>

    <p>
      But Jack didn't care. Jack was scum who crushes hopes and dreams.
      He promptly started climbing that beanstalk, <br> destroying the beanstalk's...stalks as he did so.
      </p>

    <p>
      The climbing continued for hours...or at least it seemed to
      because Jack never learned to tell time. <br>
      But finally, when his reign of terror was finally done,
      and Jack had reached the top,
      he turned back to look upon the carnage that <br> he had betrothed (this is the appropriate verbage)
      with his climbing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      His eyes fell upon the face of the crumpled, crippled, crambled beanstalk...<br>and
      that's when Jack fell to his knees in the kind of abject terror that
      only happens in short stories.<br><br>
      For he recognized that face. <br> It was just like his own. <br>
      The beanstalk was none other than his twin brother! #JustSpookyEndings
