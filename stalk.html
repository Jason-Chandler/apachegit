    <title>Stalk and the Jackbean</title>
    <h1>Stalk and the Jackbean</h1>
    <p>
      Stalk's phone was off the hook. He really couldn't understand why. <br>
      As a private investigator, he would never want to rid himself of one of his only <br>
      methods of getting business. As a man with no training besides what he picked up from noir films <br>
      and romantic comedies, he needed all the help he could get. <br> He hung up the phone.
      </p>

    <p>
      Scanning the room that functioned as his office, bedroom, and anti-bully fortress, <br>
      Stalk finally found the evidence he needed to prove that there had been a break-in. <br>
      The last jackbean from his prized jackbean collection (his main source of the important lectin, concanavalin A)<br>
      had been hastily thrown in the middle of the floor!<br>
      <br>
      <br> "My precious concanavalin A!" He shouted. (Look it up) <br>
      <br> No sooner had he shouted than did he realize that it wasn't a jackbean, but a coffeebean. <br>
      There was no concanavalin A in that thing at all and Stalk was ashamed to be alive. <br>
      </p>

    <p>
      Meanwhile, his suspicions skyrocketed. Somebody had to be in his office.<br>
      Everyone knows only bullies drink coffee and Stalk knew better than anyone <br>
      that only complete snobs would carry their own beans around with them. <br>
      He did what any sane person would do. <br> <br>
      "Come out with your hands up, you coffee cobbler!" <br> <br> 
      The walls were paper thin. There'd be complaints from every other apartment, guaranteed.
      </p>

    <p>
      As if actually responding to a person with little to no authority and a degree printed from the internet, <br>
      the coffee snob jumped from behind Stalk's personal indoor basketball hoop. <br>
      (The walls were paper thin. There'd been a lot of complaints from every other apartment, guaranteed.)<br>
      <br> "Haha! Looks like you managed to make a field goal this time, Stalk!" The coffee snob festooned.<br><br>
      Needless to say, Stalk did what any sane man would do and threw a basketball at the snob, no questions asked. <br>
      Coffee snobs have hollow bones, much like birds, so he immediately fell to the floor in a pool of his own bad decisions. <br>
      Stalk looked on smugly, as if he had any idea of what was going on or where this story was going.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      His eyes fell upon the face of the crundled, craggled, crozzled coffee snob...<br>and
      that's when Stalk fell to his knees in the kind of abject terror that
      only happens in short stories.<br><br>
      For he recognized that face. <br> It was just like his own. <br>
      The coffee snob was none other than his twin brother! #JustSpookyEndings
